- **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** Exploring AI concepts and technologies to create intelligent systems.
- **Neural Networks:** Learning about different neural network architectures and their applications in various domains.
- **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Java:** Enhancing problem-solving skills and understanding of fundamental algorithms and data structures.

## Skills
- **Programming Languages:** Python, C
- **ML Libraries & Frameworks:** Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch ,StreamLit
- **Data Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

## Projects
1. **Anime Recommendation System:** A machine learning project that recommends anime based on user preferences using popularity and rating metrics.
2. **Phone Feature Recommendation System:** A ML project that suggests phones based on a list of preferred features.
3. **Multiple disease prediction system** A ML project which diagnosis if the user has a disease or not 

## Goals
- Master neural networks and deep learning techniques.
- Contribute to open-source AI and ML projects.
- Continuously enhance my skills in data science and machine learning.
