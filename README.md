## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a tech enthusiast currently studying at Bharati Vidyapeeth College of Engineering, where I'm pursuing a degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE). My passion lies in the fields of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I'm proficient in various ML techniques and am currently delving into the exciting world of neural networks.

## My Interests
- **Machine Learning (ML):** Developing models, working with datasets, and applying ML algorithms to solve real-world problems.
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** Exploring AI concepts and technologies to create intelligent systems.
- **Neural Networks:** Learning about different neural network architectures and their applications in various domains.
- **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Python:** Enhancing problem-solving skills and understanding of fundamental algorithms and data structures.

## Skills
- **Programming Languages:** Python,Js,java,c
- **ML Libraries & Frameworks:** Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch 
- **Data Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn,Power BI, Excel
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

## Projects
1. **Music Recommendation System:** A machine learning project that recommends Music based on a Similar song.
2. **Data Summariser webapp:** A DL project which summarises the text given .
3. **Multiple disease prediction system** A ML project which diagnosis if the user has a disease or not
4. **sentiment sense webapp** : A ML webapp which uses ML to sense the sentiment of text given.
5. **Music Genre classifier** : A DL webapp which uses DL to classify music into different genres.
6. **Diagnosify**: leverages SVMs to analyze user-provided medical data and predict the presence of diseases.


## Goals
- Master neural networks and deep learning techniques.
- Contribute to open-source AI and ML projects.
- Continuously enhance my skills in data science and machine learning.
